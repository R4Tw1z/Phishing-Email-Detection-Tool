# Phishing-Email-Detection-Tool
Project Overview The goal of this project is to develop a tool that can analyze email content and classify it as either phishing or legitimate. You will use a pre-trained language model (such as GPT-4 or BERT) to extract features from the email content and then use a simple machine learning algorithm to classify the emails.
